First of all, welcome to Nancy! Our main inspiration is the Sinatra framework for Ruby and, hence, Nancy was named after the daughter of Frank Sinatra :) Many people wonder what **Fx** in NancyFx means so here it is (drum roll); it just means *framework*! NancyFx is the name of the umbrella project that contains all the components.

These guides will give you a quick tour of some of the features in Nancy without diving into too many details. There will be more to things than meets the eye so we invite you to explore Nancy on your own as well!

Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .NET and [Mono](http://mono-project.com). The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.

This means that everything in Nancy is setup to have sensible defaults and conventions, instead of making you jump through hoops and go through configuration hell just to get up and running. With Nancy you can go from zero to website in a matter of minutes. Literally.

Nancy is designed to handle `DELETE`, `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` requests and provides a simple, elegant, [Domain Specific Language (DSL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for returning a response with just a couple of keystrokes, leaving you with more time to focus on the important bits.. **your** code and **your** application.

All of this is built, by the community, as an open-source framework, meaning you get full access to the source code, and is licensed under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

You can get Nancy from [Nuget](http://nuget.org), [our TeamCity server](http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project112&tab=projectOverview&guest=true) (for latest builds) or download the source from our [GitHub repositories](http://nancyfx.org).
